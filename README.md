Path of Exile party-app used to track gear, inventory, currency, maps and more of partymembers with cross-league support.

You could use this app to either improve the party-experience with your current party, or group up with your friends from different leagues while talking in discord with each other to share your character-data.

## Important

We do not own a code-signing certificate for the application, which means you will receive a warning the first time you launch the .exe. To get around this, just press "More info" -> "Run anyway" when it pops up, and the warning won't be displayed for you again.

## Platform

Currently runs with:

- .NET Core 2.1.0
- SignalR (.NET Core) 1.0.0 w/ Redis caching
- Angular v6.0.3
- Angular-CLI v6.0.3
- Electron v2.0.1
- Electron Builder v20.13.4
- Robot-JS v.2.0.0

## Help with development

If you want to help with development we gladly accept pull-requests. To set up the project, install the latest angular-cli version globally. The following commands will help in setting up the client:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
npm run rebuild (to bundle robot-js and node-ffi)
npm start (to serve the project)
npm run electron:windows (to build the installer)
```

See https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron for additional commands.

To run the API you'll need a local redis-server. 

If you're interested in helping with development, contact us directly on discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/ymr3VnA and we'll help setting it up.
